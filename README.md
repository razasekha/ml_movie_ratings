This is a personal project I started to try see if machine learning can help me decide what film to watch. I've compiled a lot of data about films and have engineered a lot of features.

The notebook creates an ensemble model and produces quite nice results. If you want to make a model to predict your taste, you can replace 'raza_ratings' with a similarly formatted csv file with your personal ratings.
